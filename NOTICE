Purpose: I wanted to have reference bash commands to launch both Ubuntu and Alma Linux 9 LXC 4.0 Containers
     and I wanted to the use the 'lxc' command line interface to LXD.
     
     After running lxd init, I noticed the traditional lxc-destroy, and other commands didn't work.
     
     This script provides the updated commands needed after performing lxd init and selecting the recommended 4.0 version.
     
     Comments welcome.
